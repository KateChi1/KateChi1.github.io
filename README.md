Current location: Boston, MA

Education:
M.A., Economics, Boston University (2023) //
BBA., Business & Economics, The George Washington University (2019)

Research interests include: 
- Energy & environmental economics
- Net-zero pathways
- Coal-fired power plants
- Development finance & debt distress in the Global South

Questions I am currently exploring:
Energy transition: "how can developed nations accelerate fossil fuel phase-out, and what are the strategies in developing states?
How do developing nations achieve low-carbon growth as energy security and sovereign debt sustainability hinge on negotiations with major creditors such as the United States and China?"
Social cost of carbon: "what has been achieved and what is neccessary to realize effective carbon tax?"
